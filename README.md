TensorBoard is a powerful visualization tool when building machine learning models. However it can quickly become quite unwieldy as the number of model versions and runs increases.

TensorBoard Projects provides a UI to manage Tensorboard runs and allows you to easily:
* Visualize runs for a given model
    * Runs can also be archived
    * Runs can also be deleted
* Start TensorBoard dashboard for a subset of model runs
* Write documentation for a model

As the project is still very much in development, please report any issues or features you would like to see added !
